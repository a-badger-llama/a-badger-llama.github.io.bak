The most successful people atre the ones who immerse themselves in their work. The best way to do this without going crazy is to make your work something that you enjoy doing anyway and find ways to make money doing it.

But remember, it is still work. I really enjoy writing and I’ve almost always done it to some extent but only recently did I decide that I might be able to and should even try to make money doing it.

So I’m on a journey to figure out how to make that work for me. I think it self evident that I cannot simply write and expect to get paid for it. In order to get paid for anything, there has to be a mechanism in place that converts the product into currency.

In other words, I have to learn the business of writing and I need to write.

I’m on a simplification kick right now in my life. I used to be in sales and there was a phrase that they like to throw around.

Spend more time with better prospects. Basically, work smarter, not harder. People say that too and it’s important. My problem is that I get analysys paralysis.

Really, time is my greatest resource. I also need to support myself and my lifestyle. I put those as two different categories because the minimum to support myself would not support my lifestyle. My fulltime job provides for both those things, but does it afford me time to pursue my dream of being a full time author?

When I decided to change industries from sales to programming, it required well over a thousand hours to do so. That’s over a thousand hours of focused effort. I accelerated that process by quitting my job and essentially making it my fulltime job to learn to program then to find a paying job doing it.

Those thousand-plus hours were just to get to the minimum required level to make money doing it. And I wasn’t making much (as far as programmers go). After that, my education continued but with one important difference. I was being paid to learn, and we called it “doing my job.”

So I suppose the best way to learn something is by hands on experience and the best way to learn that is by making it my job. Or at least an obligation with actual tasks that I have to get done.

Keeping in mind the thousand hours to acquire the skill to a minimum threshold to get paid to do it, I have set aside three hours a day that are supposedly for the express purpose of writing. In reality, I am probably only effective for half that time on a good day. Furthermore, how can I be productive in that time frame?

With a so-called soft skill like writing (as opposed to programming) I would argue that the best thing for me would be to simply spend time doing it. When I was learning to program, I had a curriculum with projects specifically contrived to encapsulate specific lessons. I also had an instructor who facilitated that whole process.

So I don’t want to enroll in a program for writing. Clearly I already know how to write. The reason that was so effective was because I had hands on projects that I had to learn new principles to complete. I can provide this same type of structure for myself.

I do think it’s important to keep learning. I have spun my wheels for the last year insisting that I’m already a writer. Afterall, I’ve been writing my whole life right? The hard lesson I’ve learned is that there is a huge difference between an hobbiest and a professional.

So I’m over that now and I’ve humbled myself. I admit that I don’t know what I don’t know. I don’t have the habits and discipline of a professional. I am not immersed in the lifestyle. I have only been a hobbyist up to this point.

That said, I intend to spend a certain amount of time every day studying. I am currently focussing heavily on the Save the Cat! framework. My goal is to become an expert storyteller so that I can pretty much jump into any story and I don’t have to think about it too hard. I don’t think I need too much time for study. About thirty minutes a day aught to do it.

The next major focus for me needs to be specific projects. The rest of my time should be project work. Well… project work includes things like this. I’m calling this my work-life journal. I’ll probably make it into a blog at some point just so that I can have people follow my work if they want and know what I’m up to. I thnk I will benefit from the support and also accountability of that.
